# Challenge 3: Traveling Salesman Problem

## Objective:
Find the optimal route that visits all locations exactly once and returns to the starting point.

## Instructions:
- **Start and End:** The DUC

## Suggested Methods:
1. **Nearest neighbor heuristic:** Build the route step-by-step by always visiting the nearest unvisited location.
2. **Simulated annealing:** Search for an optimized route by gradually improving random paths.
