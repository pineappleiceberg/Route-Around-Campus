# Challenge 2: Optimal Score Route (Greedy vs. Dynamic Programming)

## Objective:
Maximize the total score by visiting a set of locations within a limited distance (5.0 km).

## Instructions:
- **Start and End:** Walker Hall
- Plan your route to maximize your score while staying within the distance limit.

## Approaches:
1. **Greedy algorithm:** Choose the highest-score location at each step.
2. **Dynamic programming:** Plan the route to maximize the total score across all steps.

## Constraints:
- The total distance traveled cannot exceed **5.0 km**.
