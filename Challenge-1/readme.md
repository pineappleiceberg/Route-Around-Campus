# Challenge 1: Shortest Path Challenge

## Objective
Find the **shortest path** between two given points using the distances provided in the JSON data. You can any method or technique you want to solve this challenge!

## Instructions
- **Start:** Potter Hall
- **End:** Maryville Softball Field

## Possible methods (but not all of them)
1. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:**
   Use the locations as nodes in a graph and use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path based on the distances between each location

2. **A\* (A-star) Algorithm:**
   Use the Haversine formula or another heuristic to guide the search for the shortest path
