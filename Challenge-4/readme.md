# Challenge 4: Network Flow and Bottleneck Analysis

## Objective:
Identify the **bottleneck locations** in the network by calculating the shortest paths from every location to every other location.

## Suggested Method:
- Use either **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** or **Johnsonâ€™s algorithm** to compute all-pairs shortest paths.
- Identify the locations that appear most frequently in these paths (i.e., bottlenecks).
